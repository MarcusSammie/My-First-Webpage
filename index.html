       <!-- Question one-->
    <p>
     
   With programming, the greatest challenge is often not the complexity of the language, but rather staying consistent and motivated through the learning process.

In order to stay consistent with your learning, i will need a lot of motivation and energy. The consistency with which i learn would help me to understand the complex concepts of any programming language and make the most of my time.
When you are learning to code, it seems like one of the most difficult things on the planet. For many, it is not only a matter of learning a new skill, it is a process of adjusting to a completely new way of thinking and in the early stages, when the computer is throwing you error after error, you feel like you cannot do anything right. Negative thoughts begin to creep in and you will undoubtedly find yourself questioning whether you are really cut out for this.

This process of transitioning to a new mindset is incredibly difficult when you are just starting out, so here are a few steps you can take to make the ride a little easier. They worked for me and I hope they can work for you too.
